# Welcome to *Swarm-Rescue*

With this project, you will try to save human lives, in simulation... Teach a swarm of drones how to behave to save a maximum of injured people in a minimum of time!

Your job will be to propose your own version of the controller of the drone. In a competition, each participating team will perform on a new unknown map, the winner will be the one who gets the most points based on several criteria: speed, quality of exploration, number of injured people saved, number of drones returned, etc.

*Swarm-Rescue* is the environment that simulates the drones and that describes the maps used, the drones and the different elements of the map.

[Access to the GitHub repository *Swarm-Rescue*](https://github.com/emmanuel-battesti/swarm-rescue)

The Challenge does not require any particular technical skills (beyond basic knowledge of *Python*), and will mainly mobilize creativity and curiosity from the participants.

# The Competition

The objective of the mission is to map an unknown, potentially hostile area, detect targets (injured or healthy people), and guide them out of the area. A typical use case is to investigate the basement of a collapsed building in the dark, in order to locate trapped people and rescue them.

Each team will have a fleet of 10 drones. Each drone will be equipped with communication functions and sensors.

**Your job is to make these drones completely autonomous by programming them in *Python*.**

The drones will have to manage the limited range of the communication means, collaborate between them to acquire information and share information, be able to manage sensor and communication means failures and unforeseen events such as the loss of drones in order to conduct this mission autonomously.

The work on the challenge will be done **exclusively in this simulation environment**, with maps of increasing complexity. The final evaluation will be done on an unknown map designed by the organizers and not available to the contestants. Every proposition will be tested on a same computer and a score related to the performance will be computed.


## Score

Depending on the scenario evolution before the final evaluation, the score calculation may be slightly modified.

First, the execution of your algorithms will be stopped after a while. There are two time-limits:
- time step limit: a number of loops in the simulation
- real time limit: a limit in minutes, depending on the map and the computer speed: 2 to 5 minutes.

When the first limit is reached, the game is over. If your algorithm is fast, you will reach the "step time limit" first. If your algorithm is too slow, you will reach the "real time limit" before the "time step limit" .

To calculate the score, the following elements will be taken into account:
- the part of the territory explored: you have to explore a maximum of the map
- the number of fixed targets detected, brought back to the base,
- the number of mobile targets detected, brought back to the base.

If all the targets are brought back to base and all the map is explored, the speed in "time step" will be taken into account.

## Details on the rules

- You can only use the detection of WoundedPerson, RescueCenter and other Drones with the Semantic sensor, but not the Walls (as it is unrealistically giving you the full wall size and position). Use Lidar to detect/avoid Walls.

# Simple-Playgrounds 

This program *Swarm-Rescue* is an extension of the *Simple-Playgrounds* (SPG) software library: [https://github.com/mgarciaortiz/simple-playgrounds](https://github.com/mgarciaortiz/simple-playgrounds). However, in the current installation of *Swarm-Rescue*, it is the branch *swarm-rescue-v2* of a fork of *Simple-Playgrounds* that is used: [https://github.com/emmanuel-battesti/simple-playgrounds](https://github.com/emmanuel-battesti/simple-playgrounds).


It is recommended to read the [documentation of *Simple-Playgrounds*](https://github.com/emmanuel-battesti/simple-playgrounds#readme).

*Simple-Playgrounds* is an easy-to-use, fast and flexible simulation environment. It bridges the gap between simple and efficient grid environments, and complex and challenging 3D environments. It proposes a large diversity of environments for embodied drones learning through physical interactions. The playgrounds are 2D environments where drones can move around and interact with scene elements.

The game engine, based on [Pymunk](http://www.pymunk.org) and [Arcade](https://api.arcade.academy/), deals with simple physics, such as collision and friction. Drones can act through continuous movements and discrete interactive actions. They perceive the scene with realistic first-person view sensors, top-down view sensors, and semantic sensors.

## Game Engine

In *Simple-Playgrounds*, the game engine used is *Arcade*. Drones enter a Playground, and start acting and perceiving within this environment. The perception/action/communication loop is managed by the game engine. At each time step, all perception is acquired, all communication are done. Then according to actions to do, drones are moved. Everything is synchronized, unlike what you would get on a real robot.

## Physics Engine

In *Simple-Playgrounds*, the 2d physics library *Pymunk* is used. The physic engine deals with simple physics, such as collision and friction. This gives a mass and inertia to all objects.


# Installation on Ubuntu

This installation procedure has been tested with Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04.

## Arcade library dependencies

First, you will obviously have to use the Git tool.

And for the library *Arcade*, you might need to install *libjpeg-dev* and *zlib1g-dev*.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev
```

## *Python* installation

We need, at least, *Python 3.8*.

- On *Ubuntu 20.04*, the default version of *Python* is 3.8.
- On *Ubuntu 18.04*, the default version of *Python* is 2.7.17. And the default version of *Python3* is 3.6.9.

But it is easy to install *Python* 3.8:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.8 python3.8-venv python3.8-dev
```

## *Pip* installation

- Install *Pip*:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip 

- When the installation is complete, verify the installation by checking the *Pip* version:

```bash
pip3 --version
```

- It can be useful to upgrade *Pip* to have the last version in local directory:

```bash
/usr/bin/python3.8 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

To use the correct version, you have to use `python3.8 -m pip` instead of `pip`, for example:

```bash
python3.8 -m pip --version
```

## Virtual environment tools

The safe way to work with *Python* is to create a virtual environment around the project.

For that, you should install some tools:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install virtualenvwrapper
```
## Install this *swarm-rescue* repository

- To install this git repository, go to the directory you want to work in (for example: *~/code/*).

- Git-clone the code of [*Swarm-Rescue*](https://github.com/emmanuel-battesti/swarm-rescue):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emmanuel-battesti/swarm-rescue.git
```
This command will create the directory *swarm-rescue* with all the code inside it.

- Create your virtual environment. This command will create a directory *env* where all dependencies will be installed:

```bash
cd swarm-rescue
python3.8 -m venv env
```

- To use this newly create virtual environment, as each time you need it, use the command:

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

To deactivate this virtual environment, simply type: `deactivate`

- With this virtual environment activated, we can install all the dependency with the command:

```bash
python3.8 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3.8 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- To test, you can launch:

```bash
python3.8 ./src/swarm_rescue/launcher.py
```

## Python IDE

Although not mandatory, it is a good idea to use an IDE to code in *Python*. It makes programming easier.

For example, you can use the free *community* version of [*PyCharm*](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). In this case, you have to set your *interpreter* path to your venv path to make it work. 


# Installation on Windows 10

This installation procedure has been tested with Windows 10. Installation is also straightforward on Windows 11.

## *Python* installation

- Open this link in your web browser:  https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
- Don't choose the latest version of Python, but choose the 3.8 version. Currently (11/2022), it is the "*Python 3.8.10 - May 3, 2021*".
- For modern machine, you have to choose the *Windows x86-64 executable installer*.
- Once the installer is downloaded, run the Python installer.
- **Important** : you should check the "**Add Python 3.8 to path**"  check box to include the interpreter in the execution path.

## *Git* installation

Git is a tool for source code management. [Git is used](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/git-tutorial/what-is-git "Git is used") to tracking changes in the source code of *swarm-rescue*.

 - Download the [latest version of    Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and choose the 64/32 bit version.
 - After the file is downloaded, install it in the system.
 - Once installed, select *Launch the Git Bash*, then click on *finish*. The *Git Bash* is now launched.

We want to work later on the project by using the *Git Bash* terminal.

## Configure *Git Bash*

- Launch the *Git Bash* terminal
- **Warning**, you are **not** by default to your home directory. So to go there, just type : *cd*
- To facilitate the use of the command *python*, you have to create an alias to real position of the program python.exe : `echo "alias python='winpty python.exe'" >> ~/.bashrc`
- Then `source .bashrc` to activate the modification.
- If things are working, the command `python -V` should give the version of the python installed, for example: `Python 3.8.10`

## Install this *swarm-rescue* repository

- To install this git repository, go to the directory you want to work in (for example: *~/code/*).
- With *Git Bash*, you have to use the linux command, for example:
```bash
cd
mkdir code
cd code
```
- Git-clone the code of [*Swarm-Rescue*](https://github.com/emmanuel-battesti/swarm-rescue):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emmanuel-battesti/swarm-rescue.git
```
This command will create the directory *swarm-rescue* with all the code inside it.

- Create your virtual environment. This command will create a directory *env* where all dependencies will be installed:

```bash
cd swarm-rescue
python -m venv env
```

- To use this newly create virtual environment, as each time you need it, use the command:

```bash
source env/Scripts/activate
```

To deactivate this virtual environment, simply type: `deactivate`

- With this virtual environment activated, we can install all the dependency with the command:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- To test, you can launch:

```bash
python ./src/swarm_rescue/launcher.py
```

# Elements of the environment

## Drones

Drones is a version of what is called **agent** in *Simple-Playgrounds*.
Drones are composed of different body parts attached to a *Base*.

Drones **perceive their surroundings** through 3 first-person view sensors:
- *Lidar* sensor
- *Touch* sensor
- *Semantic* sensor

Drones have also a communication system.

Drones are equipped with sensors that allow it to **estimate its position and orientation**. We have two kinds:
- with absolute measurements: the *GPS* for the positions and the magnetic *compass* for the orientation.
- with relative measurements: the odometer which provides us with positions and orientation relative to the previous position of the drone.

### Lidar sensor

In the code, class *DroneLidar*.

It emulates a lidar.

- *fov* (field of view): 360 degrees
- *resolution* (number of rays): 181
- *max range* (maximum range of the sensor): 300 pixels

A gaussian noise has been added to the distance.
As the *fov* is 360°, the first (at -Pi rad) and the last value (at Pi) should be the same.

You can find an example of lidar use in the *solutions/my_drone_lidar_communication.py* file.

To visualize lidar sensor data, you should set the parameter *draw_lidar* parameter of the *GuiSR* class to *True*.

### Touch sensor

In the file *src/swarm_rescue/spg_overlay/entities/drone_sensors.py*, it is described in the class *DroneTouch*.

The touch sensor detects close proximity of entities (objects or walls) near the drone.
As the *fov* is 360°, the first (at -Pi rad) and the last value (at Pi) should be the same.

It emulates artificial skin,

- *fov* (field of view): 360 degrees
- *resolution* (number of rays): 13
- *max range* (maximum range of the sensor): 25 pixels

A gaussian noise has been added to the distance.
The return value is between 0 and 1.

You can find an example of touch sensor use in the *examples/example_touch_sensor.py* and the *solutions/my_drone_random.py* files.

To visualize touch sensor data, you should set the parameter *draw_touch* parameter of the *GuiSR* class to *True*.

### Semantic sensor

In the file *src/swarm_rescue/spg_overlay/entities/drone_sensors.py*, it is described in the class *DroneSemanticSensor*.

The semantic sensor allows to determine the nature of an object, without data processing, around the drone.

- *fov* (field of view): 360 degrees
- *max range* (maximum range of the sensor): 200 pixels
- *resolution*, number of rays evenly spaced across the field of view: 35

As the *fov* is 360°, the first (at -Pi rad) and the last value (at Pi) should be the same.

You can find an example of semantic sensor use in the *examples/example_semantic_sensor.py* file. For this competition, you can only use the detection of *WoundedPerson*, *RescueCenter* and other *Drones*, but not the *Walls* (use lidar for this).
The sensor *DroneSemanticSensor* used in your drone is a modified version of the class *SemanticSensor* of SPG.

Each ray of the sensor provides a data with:
- *data.distance*: distance of the nearest object detected
- *data.angle*: angle of the ray in radians
- *data.entity_type*: type of the detected object
- *data.grasped*: is the object grasped by a drone or an agent ?

If a wall is detected, distance and angle will be 0, to avoid to use it.

A gaussian noise has been added to the data distance.

To visualize touch semantic data, you should set the parameter *draw_semantic* parameter of the *GuiSR* class to *True*.

### GPS sensor

In the file *src/swarm_rescue/spg_overlay/entities/drone_sensors.py*, it is described in the class *DroneGPS*.

This sensor gives the position vector along the horizontal axis and vertical axis.
The position (0, 0) is at the center of the map.
Noise has been added to the data to make it look like GPS noise. This is not just gaussian noise but noise that follows an autoregressive model of order 1.

If you want to enable the visualization of the noises, you should set the parameter *enable_visu_noises* to *True*.

### Compass sensor

In the file *src/swarm_rescue/spg_overlay/entities/drone_sensors.py*, it is described in the class *DroneCompass*.

This sensor gives the orientation of the drone.
The orientation increases with a counter-clockwise rotation of the drone. The value is between -Pi and Pi. 
Noise has been added to the data to make it look like Compass noise. This is not just gaussian noise but noise that follows an autoregressive model of order 1.

If you want to enable the visualization of the noises, you should set the parameter *enable_visu_noises* to *True*.

### Odometer sensor

In the file *src/swarm_rescue/spg_overlay/entities/drone_sensors.py*, it is described in the class *DroneOdometer*.

This sensor returns an array of data containing:
- dist_travel, the distance of the drone's movement during the last timestep.
- alpha, the relative angle of the current position with respect to the previous reference frame of the drone
- theta, the orientation variation (or rotation) of the drone during the last step in the reference frame
     
Those data are relative the previous position of the drone. Usually, we use odometry by integrating measurements over time to get an estimate of the current position of the drone. 
This can be very useful for example when GPS data is no longer provided in some areas of the map.

Angles, alpha and theta, increase with a counter-clockwise rotation of the drone. Their value is between -Pi and Pi. 
Gaussian noise was added separately to the three parts of the data to make them look like real noise. 

![odometer values](img/odom.png)

If you want to enable the visualization of the noises, you should set the parameter *enable_visu_noises* to *True*. It will show also a demonstration of the integration of odometer values, by drawing the estimated path.

### Communication

Each drone can communicate with all the drones in a certain range (currently, 200 pixels).
At each time step, data can be sent and/or received.

You have the possibility to configure the content of the messages yourself.

You can find an example of communication use in the *solutions/my_drone_lidar_communication.py* file.

### Actuators

At each time step, you must provide values for your actuators.

You have 3 values to move your drone:
- *forward_controller*, a float value between -1 and 1. This is a force apply to your drone in the longitudinal way.
- *lateral_controller*, a float value between -1 and 1. This is a force apply to your drone in the lateral way.
- *angular_vel_controller*, a float value between -1 and 1. This is the speed of rotation. 

To interact with the world, you can *grasp* certain *graspable* thing. To move a *wounded person*, you will have to *grasp* it.
This value *grasp* is either 0 or 1.

When a wounded person is grasped by the drone, it disappears for the drone sensors, i.e. it becomes transparent. This allows the drone to navigate more easily without having its sensors obstructed.

You can find examples of actuator use in almost all files in *examples/* and *solutions/*.

## Playground

Drones act and perceive in a *Playground*.

A *playground* is composed of scene elements, which can be fixed or movable. A drone can grasp certain scene elements. 
The playground with all its elements, except for the drones, are called "Map" within this *Swarm-Rescue* repository.

### Coordinate System

A playground is described using a Cartesian coordinate system.

Each element has a position (x,y, theta), with x along the horizontal axis, y along the vertical axis, and theta the orientation in radians, aligned on the horizontal axis. The position (0, 0) is at the center of the map. The value of theta is between -Pi and Pi. Theta increases with a counter-clockwise rotation of the drone. For theta = 0, the drone is oriented towards the right. A playground has a size [width, height], with the width along x-axis, and height along y-axis.

## Wounded Person

A *Wounded Person* are element that appears as a yellow character on the map. As its name suggests, it is injured person that needs help from the drone. 

The drones must approach them, *grasped* them and take them to the rescue center.

You can find an example of grasping a wounded person in the *examples/example_semantic_sensor.py* file.

## Rescue Center

*Rescue Center* is a red element in the map where the drones should bring the *Wounded Person*.

A reward is given to a drone each time it gives a *Wounded Person* to the *Rescue Center*.

You can find an example of rescue center used in the *examples/example_semantic_sensor.py* file.

## Special zones

There are zones that alter the abilities of the drones. They can also call the *disablers*.

### No-Communication zone

*No-Communication zone* where a drone **loses the ability to communicate** with other drones.
It is represented on the map by a transparent yellow rectangle.
This zone cannot be directly detected by the drone.

### No-GPS zone

*No-GPS zone* where a drone **loses the possibility to know its GPS position and Compass orientation**.
It is represented on the map by a transparent grey rectangle.
This zone cannot be directly detected by the drone.

### Killing zone (or deactivation zone)

*Killing zone* where a **drone is destroyed automatically.**
It is represented on the map by a transparent pink rectangle.
This zone cannot be detected by the drone.


# Programming

## Architecture of *Swarm-Rescue*

### file *launcher.py*

*launcher.py* is the main program file to launch a swarm of drones using your code. This file will run everything needed to perform the evaluation.

It will launch the 10 drones that you will have customized in the map that you want, make it run and give the final score.

This file needs almost no modification to work, except those lines at the beginning of the file:

```python
class MyMap(MyMapComplete01):
    pass


class MyDrone(MyAwesomeDrone):
    pass
```

*MyMap* must inherit from the class of the map you want to use (here, in the example *MyMapComplete01*). This map will be located in the folder *maps*.

*MyDrone* must inherit from the class of the drone that you created (here, in the example, your awesome drone *MyAwesomeDrone*). This drone will be located in the folder *solutions*.

### directory *spg_overlay*

As its name indicates, this folder is a software overlay of the spg (simple-playground) code.
 It contains three sub-directories:
 - *entities*: contains description of different entities used in the program.
- *gui_map*: contains description of default map and the gui interface.
- *utils*: contains various functions and useful tools.

The files it contains must *not* be modified. It contains the definition of the class *Drone*, of the class of the sensors, of the wounded persons, etc.

An important file is the *gui_map/gui_sr.py* which contains the class *GuiSR*. 
If you want to use the keyboard to move the first drone, you should set the parameter *use_keyboard* to *True*.
If you want to enable the visualization of the noises, you should set the parameter *enable_visu_noises* to *True*. It will show also a demonstration of the integration of odometer values, by drawing the estimated path.

### directory *maps*

This directory contains the maps in which the drones can move. New maps may appear for new missions with the updates of this repository. You can also make your own maps based on existing ones.

Each map must inherit from the class *MapAbstract*.

### directory *solutions*

This directory will contain your solutions. Taking inspiration from what is there and going beyond, you will put in the code that will define your drones and how they interact with their environment.

Each Drone must inherit from the class *DroneAbstract*. You have 2 mandatory member functions: **define_message_for_all()** that will define the message sent between drone, and **control()** that will give the action to do for each time step.

Keep in mind, that the same code will be in each of the 10 drones. Each drone will be an instance of your Drone class.

For your calculation in the control() function, it is mandatory to use only the sensor and communication data, without directly accessing the class members. In particular, you should not use the *position* and *angle* variables, but use the *measured_gps_position()* and *measured_compass_angle()* functions to have access to the position and orientation of the drone. These values are noisy, representing more realistic sensors, and can be altered by special zones in the map where the position information can be scrambled.

The true position of the drone can be accessed with the functions *true_position()* and *true_angle()* (or directly with the variable *position* and *angle*), BUT it is only for debugging or logging.

Some examples are provided:
- *my_drone_random.py* shows the use of touch sensors and actuators
- *my_drone_lidar_communication.py* shows the use of lidar and communication between drones

### directory *examples*

In the folder, you will find stand-alone programs to help you program with examples. In particular:
- *display_lidar.py* shows a visualization of the lidar on a graph. You can see the noise added.
- *example_disablers.py* shows an example of each *disabling zone*.
- *example_semantic_sensor.py* shows the use of semantic sensor and actuators, and how to grasp a wounded person and bring it back to the rescue area.
- *example_touch_sensor.py* shows the use of touch sensors and actuators.
- *example_keyboard.py* shows how to use the keyboard for development or debugging purpose. The usable keyboard keys :
	- up / down key : forward and backward
	- left / right key : turn left / right
	- shift + left/right key : left/right lateral movement
	- g key : grasp objects
	- l key : display (or not) the lidar sensor
	- s key : display (or not) the semantic sensor
	- t key : display (or not) the touch sensor
	- q key : exit the program
	- r key : reset

### directory *tools*

In this directory, you may find some tools... For example, the program *image_to_map.py* allows to build a map from a black and white image.

## Submission

At the end of the competition, you will have to submit your solution to your evaluator. The evaluator of your code will have this same software to evaluate your solution.

Be careful, you will provide only:
- the code to run your simulated drone, which will only come from the *solutions* directory,
- the list of new dependencies needed to make your drone work.

## Various tips

- To exit elegantly after launching a map, press 'q'.
